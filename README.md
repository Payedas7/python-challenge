Module #3|Assignment:Python
----------------------------

There are two diffrenet datasets one is budget.csv and another is election .csv.
using python in spyder developement environment the code was written to get results based on 
some particular analysis.

Budget.csv
----------
The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Election.csv
------------
The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
  
  
  -after that in the both cases output has been taken to a Text(.txt) file.
  to execute this code in induvidual environment the paths for the csv files and the output file must be 
  taken care of by the executer.
  The files data were not so detailed or big, the code should work fine with the big files with large number of data as well.
  This assignment was done to enhance skill and for the basic understanding about Python.
